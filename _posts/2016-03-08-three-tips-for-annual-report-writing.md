I have written and coordinated a lot of annual reports over the years. I have seen some spectacular successes as well as cases I would rather not mention.

I have written and coordinated a lot of annual reports over the years. I have seen some spectacular successes as well as cases I would rather not mention.

So, once you know you have an annual report due, what should you do? Where do you start?[To download your FREE copy of our Annual Report writing white paper, subscribe to our newsletter][0].

Ideally, you should start with a **timeline**, knowing when the report is due. If there is not a specific due date, then know when you would like the report complete. Work backwards from there to understand what needs to be done when between now and the due date.

Now think about the **audience**. If you are writing for a funding body_,_our view is that you should broaden your horizon. Why go to all that trouble just to_tick a box_for your funding agency? Surely the resources (your resources) would be put to best use if they are always serving you, your project and your organisation.

Then, create a **sketch**of the report (e.g. series of headings and likely number of pages)

**NOW get content!**

Easy to say, difficult to achieve. However, there are some tricks you can use:

1. Email contributors (researchers, collaborators or staff). Ask for content or reports on their specific activity. Let them know the timeline, audience and sketch. Make sure you set a deadline.
2. Review your website. Most organisations post their achievements on their websites, so it naturally becomes a great archive of activity.
3. Review meeting agendas and minutes. Similarly to your website, meeting agendas and minutes will often document achievements, activities and outcomes. Make use of them.
4. Draft and re-draft. People prefer to edit existing information, rather than create from new. So send them drafts or draft something for them to update.
