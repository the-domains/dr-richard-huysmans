# Can your collaboration survive an emergency?

In collaborations, often specific people are allocated specific roles. This works at the start, but as time progresses does it limit a collaborations' success or its ability to survive an emergency?

I recently had a family holiday to Sydney. Not that long, but long enough to have a break and also realise how difficult it is for four people to live out of a suit case.

To increase the difficulty level just that little bit -- I managed to lose my wallet three days before we left. Of course, I cancelled all of my cards and had new ones issued, but none arrived before we left for Sydney. So we left for Sydney only my wife having access to our accounts. No problems there.

Of course, we are on holiday so everything gets put onto credit card. Part way through the trip the credit card is maxed. No drama - I'll just jump on line and pay it down. Except with all my cards cancelled and yet to be re-issued, I cannot get access to online banking, or telephone banking, or mobile banking. So we needed to use our eftpos card. That has a daily limit that we soon reach. So now no money. Although my wife could use her online, mobile and telephone banking we never bothered to set that up. I just did it all. So here we are on holiday spending the better part of a Saturday sorting out banking that would not have needed sorting if we'd both had internet banking set up in the first place.

It got me thinking about teams and collaborations and how they tend to be very person centric. That is, specific people have specific roles. These roles are often highly specialised within the team or the collaboration. When teams and collaborations start out, this makes sense as it allows rapid start up. But once we get going, it makes more sense to spread the load. This can be done through training others and documenting processes and procedures; or introducing other team members to the collaboration.

However, often times we get caught up doing the work, or project. We forget to implement some redundancy into the team or collaboration when _times are good_. That means when things go bad (people leave or get sick) or get stressful (relationships become strained) we don't have a feasible back-up plan -- say another person to perform the task in the interim, or another person to take the lead on the collaboration.

So, what parts of your team or collaboration are key to success? And could you put something in place to reduce reliance on a specific individual? In the end you'll increase the skills amongst your team or collaboration, while also giving all team members a better appreciation of the work performed by other team members.
