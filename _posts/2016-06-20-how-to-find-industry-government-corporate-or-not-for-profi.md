# **How to find industry, government, corporate or not-for-profit research partners**

Despite all of the election speak, we are still trying to transition to an innovation economy.

For researchers and universities, many of the changes are still being worked through and debated in the election. Regardless of the election outcome it is still as important as ever to do our best -- as researchers -- to ensure our expertise and findings make their way into the lives of others. This could be as new treatments, new processes, new procedures or changed products.

However, there are some changes that are about to become real.

So, how do we do that? And what are the immediate opportunities?

The most immediate opportunity is an [Australian Research Council Linkage Grant][0]. As of 1 July 2016 they are continuously open. That means, if you are a university researcher and have an industry, government, corporate or not-for-profit partner (or vice versa) you can apply to have your project assessed (and funded) at any time.

However, for many this is easier said than done. In our experience the biggest barrier to a successful Linkage, Partnership or other industry grant is not a good project -- its good partners. A major barrier to getting good partners is fear -- fear of having ideas on display that others might take apart. Fear that the work does not have industry relevance. However, there are many tools that can help researchers overcome these fears or barriers to engagement. Social media -- and LinkedIn in particular -- is one such example.

Of course, using social brings its own set of fears -- but it does not have to. Here's why:

**It's a-synchronous** -- we can logon and engage in our own time at our own pace. We can get the advice and support of others before we decide to respond or react.

**It's always on** -- we can be asleep and others can be online checking our profile, reading our posts and getting to know us. Similarly, we can be investigating (vetting) our potential partners without the need to talk to them directly.

**It's ubiquitous** -- everyone is using it. In the case of LinkedIn (unlike all other social media) it is expressly for the purpose of people in _business_ (of all types, shapes, colours and flavours) engaging and working with other people in _business_. People use LinkedIn expecting to find work, find opportunities and find collaborators.

Of the 500+ connections I have on LinkedIn, the majority (80% or so) are researchers of some kind based at a university or research institute. However, my feed (the posts I see from my connections) follows the 80:20 rule. That is, 80% of the posts come from 20% of my profile (most of my non-researcher connections). This represents a huge opportunity for researchers to use LinkedIn as it is intended -- to find (research) work, find (research) opportunities and find (research) collaborators.

You just need to participate.
