Its that time of year again in Australia - our two biggest football codes have their grand finals; cars race around a track for 1000 kms; and medical researchers begin to put _pen to paper _for their major research grants that fall due any time between October and march the following year.

In all cases planning and preparation are the keys to success, not to mention working together.

Sports are classic metaphors for all three - planning, preparation and collaboration. It seems there is a coach for everyone and everything regardless if you are in a team sport or an individual one. Each player is given a unique plan to develop their skills, overcome weaknesses and build on their strengths, timed perfectly to coincide with the finals or major competition. All the players do is come up with the goal - win the grand final, make it to the Olympics, set a new record - the rest is left to the support crew to fill in.

But how do you choose the best support crew? Who should you collaborate with to ensure your success?

**There are three questions to help build strong collaboration - and the answers are E-S-I.**

**E - Evidence: **Make decisions to collaborate based on evidence. That could be research evidence, track record, expertise or experience._Ask yourself what is the basis of our collaboration?_

**S - Speed: **Collaborative work, like any good work, should flow. Progress should be visible and palpable. Goals and outcomes should be achieved quicker than if they were pursued on their own, not weeks to get answers. Working styles complement each other, raising the bar, not nit-picking and correcting each other's work. Ask yourself _Will it be fast, or will I be furious?_

**I - Inclusive: **You should want to include your collaborators in goal setting and achievement and they should want to include you. If you have followed evidence then every partner has a reason for being in the collaboration - so they should be included. Particularly given diverse teams achieve better results than similar teams. Ask yourself _Have I included everyone? __And if not, why not?_

So, as you sit down to put together your next grant or report, build an E-S-I Team.
