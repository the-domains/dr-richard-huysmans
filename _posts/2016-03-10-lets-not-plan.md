Research is organic - it does not need to be planned.

This is a view I often hear -- and on many levels I agree. Fundamental (or basic) research into how a system (natural or created by people) operates is organic. It is driven by curiosity. Full stop.

What if you want a bigger outcome? Something more than just an understanding of how a system works? What if you wanted to create a larger-scale project, that brought multiple areas of research together - a collaboration that crossed organisations and disciplines? How do you take that idea and make it a reality? How do you really make a difference? How do you get on a pathway -- a fast track -- to impact? How do you create stronger links with industry? How can you engage philanthropy? How do you make sure all participants know what their role is (beyond do good research)? What about the administrators and their role?

Asking (and answering) three questions is the first step:

1. Why do you want to do your thing?
2. How will you achieve your thing?
3. What will you do to achieve your thing?

If you're up for it, I then suggest writing a plan in response to each. Thus:

* the answer to (1) becomes a business plan (and includes risks, budget, etc);
* the answer to (2) becomes a strategic plan (and includes internal and external context); and
* the answer to (3) becomes an implementation plan (and includes a Gantt chart, lists of activities and their timing).

Together, they will help ensure you start off on a pathway to success.

This is summarised below.
