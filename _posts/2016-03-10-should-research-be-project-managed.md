Previously, I wrote about planning for research, and that the organic and meandering nature of research can discourage planning -- at a range of levels. If you read [the article][0] you would be aware that I think research should be planned.

Beyond the nature of research -- it is often the nature of planning and project management that discourages researchers (and other non-traditional planning and project management fields) from using planning and project management tools and techniques that would benefit their work.

Talk to a _project manager _and they will have you thinking you need PMBOK, PRINCE2 or some other methodology to make sure your project is a success. There will be reams of paper or screens of data and dashboards and a lengthy Gantt chart. All will need to be monitored, checked and re-checked, with reports received from various line, section, finance or HR managers. But, in reality we all have an understanding of Project Management -- and we do it every day -- we just need some simple processes and or structures to follow to help us achieve our goal.

I've been told that all we need to make progress are goals, rules and feedback (by Dr Jason Fox) and that implementing _projects that matter _is all that matters (by Peter Cook). And I agree. Indeed, researchers arguably have the strongest calling that their projects matter. Furthermore, the research method is inherently set up to provide goals (funding, papers, findings), rules (ethics, grant guidelines) and feedback (peer review process). Let's also not forget that research is project management. Hypothesis, aims, method, results and conclusions, all put our work into a planning and project management framework. Sometimes I wonder whether this has been forgotten by some.

But, we need to move beyond experiment-to-experiment management. Capturing an entire research project (comprising several experiments) and the wider programs they contribute to. Indeed, building a career (especially an academic one) can be enhanced by such an approach.

Imagine that -- a project management tool that can help your career, not just your projects. Wouldn't that be nice?
