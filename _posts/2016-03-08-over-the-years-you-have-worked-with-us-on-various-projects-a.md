Over the years you have worked with us on various projects and proposals. Here are six areas (and more than 10 projects) that you probably don't know about.

**1\. Training and workforce development**

We offer training in a range of areas including LinkedIn and twitter for research, academic career development (including grant writing), transition from academia (including resume writing), team development and enhancement.

**2\. Developing research teams**

We work with a range of researchers across a number of universities to develop teams with the capacity and capability to tackle high-order research issues. We then take these teams to industry to solve industry problems. It's a novel approach that is seeing much stronger engagement from industry and the development of novel research teams solving diverse problems in neuroscience, disability and occupational therapy and more.

**3\. Strategic Advice**

Writing and providing strategic advice for clients is a key part of what we do. We've worked with various departments, schools or faculties of Monash University, La Trobe University, Alfred Health, the Royal District Nursing Service and the Department of Human Services. We've taken on various roles including strategy facilitator, writer, implementer and communicator -- and sometimes the whole lot.

**4\. Centre and Institute formation**

We've helped several universities write centre or institute plans that have all been approved/funded. These have included the [Living with Disability Research Centre][0], the [Monash Institute for Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences][1] and the [Health and Biomedical Informatics Centre][2].

**5\. Annual Reports**

Okay, so you probably know we do annual reports. But just in case our offering extends from coaching through to project management and even writing. We have helped deliver several [annual reports][3] and have also written a [white paper][4].

**6\. Business Management**

Working with researchers and senior academics we help implement and manage research initiatives. The type of work we do for them ranges from strategic planning, report writing, twitter, LinkedIn, event management and website development. Not to mention strategic advice and engagement with government, non-government and industry partners. You may have heard of [VBIC][5], but there is also an eResearch initiative as well as the [Living With Disability Research Centre][6].

**7\. Quality frameworks**

Across the years we have helped developed quality frameworks for a range of projects and settings. Our role has been to collect evidence on which to base a quality framework or guideline and then (with experts in the field) devise and publish the guideline/framework. We have created frameworks covering:

* [Research-focused MRI use][7];
* [clinical learning environments][8] (Best Practice Clinical Learning Environment Framework, with Darcy Associates);
* [attractive health service places to work][9] (Attractive Employer model for the Department of Health (Vic)); and
* [a framework for simulation based education and training programs][10] (SLE Quality Framework for Simulation Programs in Australian Health Care, with Simulation Australasia and also Department of Health (Fed)).
