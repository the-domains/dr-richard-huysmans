Report writing can be rewarding and sometimes fun (yeah I am a little twisted). But for those who don't like writing reports, or even those who do, there are three challenges. [To download your FREE copy of our Annual Report writing white paper, subscribe to our newsletter][0].

**Organisation (who's job is it?) **We all love to be clear on our roles, responsibility and lines of management. Invariably for projects, this is a matrix where you have a project lead and a business as usual manager. No one has the job of writing reports. Although there are project mangers and a project team, no one feels like it is their role. No one feels like they could (almost do it on their own). As a result it becomes everyone's job and no one does it (you know the ditty). We need to make sure there is role clarity.

**Time (where did it go?) **We have time pressure -- we mostly feel like we have none! For people writing reports it feels like there is a catch-22\. You can do more work, to include in the report, if you did not have to stop to write it! You could give better value to your funding agency if you spent less time reporting and more time doing. Anything we do needs to be worth our time.

**Money (do we have any?) **No one feels like their project is over-funded -- in fact most people feel like their project is under funded. So, we need to make sure every dollar is spent to achieve the most for the project.

Whether you are a Head of a Lab, the Dean of a Faculty, a CEO, a project officer or something in between, we want you to be able to [Rock Your Reports][1].

So, how can the challenges above be addressed? Here are four strategies:

* **Read **-- familiarise yourself with reporting requirements (i.e. read the rules and requirements of the organisation you are reporting about and reporting to). People often assume their funding body will let them know. In many cases that happens. BUT you need to be aware of the overarching aims of the initiative that led to the funding. So, if even if you are funded to deliver education, the funding agency could be looking for jobs as the outcome. So be mindful that you need to cover both.
* **Note **-- recognise when key reports are due and make provision (time and/or money) to get them done. Again, the funding body could remind you. Then again, they might send a template a week before the report is due. Put a reminder in your calendar and take action.
* **Plan **-- to make sure you meet or beat your deadlines. Write out the basic structure of the report. Who should write what and by when. Let people know their role in advance and then remind them again when the time is right.
* **Assign **-- make sure someone has responsibility for getting the work done and make sure they know who they are. There's no point assigning work to someone only to find they are away when it falls due. If people are assigned a role, they need to know when it should be completed.
