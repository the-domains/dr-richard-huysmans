Richard Huysmans specialises in delivering high quality Business Analytics and Management Consulting in the research, university and government sectors. He is driven by the challenge of helping organisations achieve their full potential. He has been making the impossible possible for clients in research, health and education for more than seven years. His clients appreciate his cut-through approach. He knows the sector and how to turn ideas into reality.

He helps people interested in research - across sectors and organisations that include universities, research institutes, health care within R&D departments of tech, engineering and pharmaceutical corporations- to address the three greatest challenges they face:

1. Getting funding - from grants, tenders, internal or external sources;
2. Writing - project proposals, business/strategy/implementation plans, reports, journal articles, online; and
3. Being relevant - to collaborators, partners, funders, stakeholders and the wider community.
